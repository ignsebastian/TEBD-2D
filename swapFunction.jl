    #= Producing swap gate(s) to make sure that site with index ind_1 will be right next to site with index ind_2
    The swap will be conducted on every sites, one by one
    e.g to produce swap index between 1 and 5, this function will produce a sequence of swap gate as below:
    swap (1,2), swap(2,3), swap(3,4).
    When swap(1,2) is applied, the gate will change site 1 -> site 2, and site 2 -> site 1. So now, the original
    site 1' is placed in site 2. Next, the gate will apply swap(2,3), and using the same process, the site 2 - site 3
    and site 3 -> site 2, while the original site 1', which previously placed on site 2, is now placed on site 3
